# pixiv_client

A desktop Pixiv client MVP built with `bevy_xilem`.

It demonstrates:

- Pixiv OAuth token exchange (auth code + refresh token)
- Home / Ranking / Manga / Novels / Search feeds
- Thumbnail + avatar loading
- Illustration detail overlay and bookmark action
- Login credential persistence (auto-restore refresh token on next launch)

> This project is an experimental example for learning and prototyping.

## Run

From workspace root:

- `cargo run -p pixiv_client`

## macOS deep-link bundle metadata

- `Info.plist` source for registering the `pixiv:` URL scheme lives at `examples/pixiv_client/Info.plist`.
- The running app listens for callback URIs through the activation bridge and drains pending URIs on the UI thread, similar to Pixeval’s `ProtocolActivationHub` pattern.
- `embed_plist` is no longer used here. If you package the example as a macOS `.app`, keep `Info.plist` as the bundle metadata source so Launch Services can register `pixiv://account/login?...` for the app bundle.
- For local development outside a bundled `.app`, protocol registration and callback forwarding are still handled by `bevy_xilem_activation`.

## Login Guide (English)

### Option A: Open browser directly (recommended)

1. Launch the app.
2. Click **Open Browser Login**.
   - The app will auto-generate a PKCE `code_verifier` (or reuse your current one).
   - Your default browser opens Pixiv login page.
   - The login URL follows official Android flow:
     - `https://app-api.pixiv.net/web/v1/login?code_challenge=...&code_challenge_method=S256&client=pixiv-android`
3. Complete login in browser.
4. The app registers the `pixiv:` custom URI scheme on startup.
   - If callback opens `pixiv://account/login?code=...&via=login`, the running app receives it automatically and starts token exchange.
5. If your browser does not hand off the callback automatically, copy the `code` value (or the full callback URL) manually and click **Login (auth_code)**.
6. (Optional) Save and use the refresh token with **Refresh Token** later.

### Credential persistence

- After successful login/refresh, the app persists the latest auth session locally.
- On next launch, the app auto-restores refresh token and tries refresh flow automatically.
- If auto-refresh fails, you can still log in manually as before.

### How to get `code_verifier` + `auth_code`

- `code_verifier`
  - Click **Open Browser Login**.
  - Copy the value from the app field **PKCE code_verifier**.
  - Keep this value; it must match the authorization code you are exchanging.

- `auth_code`
  - Complete login in browser.
  - In the callback URL, find query parameter `code=...`.
  - **Official callback format** (from APK routing/parser):
    - `pixiv://account/login?code=...&via=login`
    - `via=signup` is used for sign-up flow.
  - `via` is required by official app routing parser.
  - A URL like below is **not** a usable auth code callback (it has no `code`):
    - `https://accounts.pixiv.net/post-redirect?.../start?...code_challenge=...`
  - Keep following redirects until you see a URL that contains `code=`.
  - You can paste either:
    - only the code value, or
    - the full callback URL (the app auto-extracts `code`).

### How to get `refresh_token`

- After **Login (auth_code)** succeeds, the app stores session tokens.
- The **Refresh token** input is auto-filled (if it was empty).
- Copy and save it for future logins.
- Later, you can paste this value and click **Refresh Token** to get a new access token.

### If **Open Browser Login** does not open a browser

- The app now tries:
   1. default browser integration, then
   2. OS fallback launcher (`open` on macOS, `xdg-open` on Linux, `start` on Windows).
- If both fail, the status line shows a full login URL; open it manually in your browser.

### If login shows `Network error: idp-urls not ready`

- This build now uses fallback Pixiv auth endpoints automatically.
- If you still see this message, make sure:
   1. your Auth code really contains `code=` (not just `post-redirect?...start?...`), and
   2. the `code_verifier` is the same one generated for that login attempt.

### If login shows redirect URI mismatch (`code:1508`)

- This usually means one of:
  1. `code_verifier` does not match the login attempt,
  2. auth code already expired/used, or
  3. redirect binding mismatch.
- This client now follows official exchange behavior:
  - token URL and `redirect_uri` come from `/idp-urls`
  - fallback redirect is `https://app-api.pixiv.net/web/v1/users/auth/pixiv/callback`
- If you still get `1508`, re-run **Open Browser Login**, keep the new `code_verifier`, and exchange immediately.

## Response Body Panel

- Network errors now keep full response details.
- The app shows them in a **scrollable response panel** (instead of putting giant text in status line).
- You can click **Copy Response Body** to copy full text to clipboard.

### Option B: Manual auth/refresh flow

If you already have `code_verifier` + `auth_code`, enter them directly and click **Login (auth_code)**.

If you already have a valid refresh token, paste it and click **Refresh Token**.

## Notes

- We currently use the **system browser** for login, not an embedded WebView.
- This avoids extra platform-specific WebView dependencies and keeps behavior close to the official app’s web auth flow.
- A true in-app WebView login can be added later, but it requires additional cross-platform integration work.
